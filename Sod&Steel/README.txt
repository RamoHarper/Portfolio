Sod & Steel is a fast-paced rogue-lite bullet/sword hell where every run is a fresh test of skill and strategy. 

Fight through waves of enemies, unlock a variety of powerful weapons, and unlock upgrades to evolve your build as you progress. 

Each attempt offers new challenges in a dynamic world where quick reflexes and smart decisions are key to survival. 

With its ever-changing gameplay, this is a game that rewards both experimentation and mastery.

During this project I was in charge of our core gameplay mechanics in this case the grass.

I also developed a companion AI that helps the player combat enemies. 

Additionally I was in charge of the achievement UI notifications. 

This project is still in progress as of May 27th, 2025 and a final build will be released at the end of June. 

In this project we used Perforce for our source control.
