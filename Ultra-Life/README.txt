UltraLife was a project I build along 5 other students were we spend 2 months creating an FPS.

During our time creating the game we used Agile methodologies specifically Scrum and used Trello as a way to track and manage our user stories and tasks. 

In total we completed 3 sprints and one round of debugging.

The game is a movement FPS where you have to traverse the simulation acquiring keys in order to exit said simulation.

My role during this project was the design of the second level as well as the enemy AI and animations. 

Attached you will find a video that will show some gameplay and is a trailer for our work.

A .txt file that will lead you to our WebGL version of the game if you want to try it!
