This project is called Conwayâ€™s Game of Life.

When coding this project I used WX Widgets as the GUI.

On this simulation each square represents a cell they can be Alive (Colored) Or dead (Standard Shade) as time passes cells determine if they continue to live or die based off the neighbor count. 

1) Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies (underpopulation). 
2) Any live cell with two or three live neighbors survives to the next generation. 
3) Any live cell with more than three live neighbors dies (overpopulation). 
4) Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes alive (reproduction). 

If you are a visual person this video may help understand a bit better
