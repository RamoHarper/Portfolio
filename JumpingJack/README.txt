Jumping Jack is a platformer inspired by Jump King

We decided to use assets that were inspired in Mario and Donkey Kong additionally this is a 3D game, we made adjustments so it seems like 2D.

This project uses an engine that we build throughout our degree the engine handles graphics using the Vulkan API the models that we import 
into the game were generated in Blender and exported into the tinygltf format. 

The game also uses ENTT as the framework which is a entity component system for C++ that facilitates how we build the game logic.

During this project my role was to handle all the game states like GameIntro,Pause,GameOver,Game Won. 

In this project I designed and implemented the UI elements specific to each Game State I also implemented the logic for each of them. 
I also had a major role in making sure the camera followed the player across levels which was an issue we had during development.
